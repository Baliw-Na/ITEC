            My experience with Keybr
        </h1>
        <h2>
            I've been using keybr for over half a year now, and I see some improvement <br>
            with my typing. I use it around 3 - 4 times a week, I can confidently say that <br>
            this site has been very useful to me. With the usage of colors, fonts and adorable <br>
            symbols it made the site much more pleasing to the eye. The contents of the site <br>
            complements each other, making it a well rounded site, and yes it is very appealing to me.
        </h2>
        <h1 style="background-color: rgb(189, 184, 179);">
            Would I recommend it? Is there something to improve?
        </h1>
        <h2>
            I would definitely recommend this site, especially to those who are looking to improve <br>
            their typing speed/skills. It record the accuracy, speed, and score/results of each test <br> 
            the user has taken, not only that but it also tackles each parts of our hand. To put <br>
            it simply, it helps us to use all of our fingers when it comes to typing and not <br>
            rely on only a set of fingers. 
            <br>
            <br>
            So far there's not much to improve on it and the it is overall perfect for me.
